        <h2>Easy dish!</h2>
        <p>This is a dish my grandparents used to make. It is so simple, yet it is so yummy! It is great in the summer and even better with homegrown zucchini.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 large zucchini, cut into large chunks</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp water, or as desired</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute zucchini until tender, about 10 minutes. Season zucchini with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs with a fork in a bowl; add water and beat until evenly combined. Pour eggs over zucchini; cook and stir until eggs are scrambled and no longer runny, about 5 minutes. Season zucchini and eggs with salt and black pepper.</li>
